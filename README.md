# api-auth-rate-limit

This project addresses the critical need for secure and scalable API access management in distributed systems. By building an authentication proxy that sits between clients and backend services, developers can centralize security policies, prevent API abuse, and implement usage-based monetization - challenges faced by organizations managing multiple microservices. The solution combines JWT/session authentication with dynamic rate limiting and quota management, while providing real-time monitoring of API consumption patterns.
